# Classwork for Numpy / Matplotlib

## Pulse Oximeter Data
The file `overall_data.dat` is a text file that contains integers separated
by commas.  The first row contains photoelectric plethysmorgraphy data from
a pulse oximeter.  The second row contains blood pressure data.  The third 
row contains ECG data.  There is no time data, so assume equal time intervals
between data points.


## Curve matching
The file `curve_to_match.dat` is a text file that contains floats separated
by commas.  The first row contains the time data.  The second row contains the
signal value.  This curve was generated by adding a sine wave and a cosine
wave:
```
curve1 = amplitude1 * sin (frequency1 * time)
curve2 = amplitude2 * cos (frequency2 * time)
```
`amplitude1`, `amplitude2`, `frequency1`, and `frequency2` were each given
integer values between 1 and 5 inclusive.  

* Read in this data and plot the signal vs. time.
* Create a sine wave and cosine wave using the formula above.
* Sum these two waves and compare to the target curve.
* Vary the values for amplitudes and frequencies until the curves match.
